Started learning Python. Work on progress, so not the best or most efficient code. 
Developed in Pythonista on iPad.

Based on Pythonista Analog Clock example. And with a little help from CoPilot.

The clock shows the time as “ten minutes past nine, quarter to 12, etc”
Speech can be turned on or off
Student must rotate the hands to the correct time. 
There are 4 levels: hours, half hours, quarter hours and on 5 minute intervals

The TellTime class supports multiple languages (English, Dutch, German). But no support yet to change language in the GUI
